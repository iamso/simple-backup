# Simple backup script

This is a very simple script that saves an archive of a source folder in a destination folder.
It also deletes the oldest file when the number of files in the destination folder exceeds 10, so make sure the destination folder only contains backups.

# Usage

```bash
bash backup.sh /path/to/src /path/to/dest
```
